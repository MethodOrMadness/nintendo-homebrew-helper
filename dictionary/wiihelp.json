    "troubleshooting": "Loader Troubleshooting:\n1: Wrong USB port. The only USB port that can run game backups is the one on the edge of the Wii(known as port 0), unless you are using d2x beta53-alt cIOS, which is not recommended as it is not as compatible.\n\n2: cIOS is not set up correctly (follow https://wii.guide/cios). We can only confirm it is done right with a syscheck (follow https://wii.guide/syscheck). Keep in mind that some games that use accessories will require a different IOS to run.\n\n3: Image is bad/corrupted. Testable in Dolphin Emulator. Make sure it's wbfs or iso (not nkit) if you're trying to play a Wii game.\n\n4: Use the latest version of your loader, use default settings and name the games as such for Wii games> USB:/wbfs/GameName [GameID]/GameID.wbfs\n\n5: USB isn't compatible. That is most likely to happen with flash drives. HDDs are always the best way to store games on the Wii.\n\n6: Don't use a forwarder. Launch the app directly from the Homebrew Channel.",
